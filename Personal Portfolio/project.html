              Developing CG-Portal Data Capturing Module to Automate a NAAC
              Reports. (ReactJS)
            </h2>
            <p>
              Details: The "CG-Portal" project is a data capturing module
              designed to automate NAAC (National Assessment and Accreditation
              Council) reports for higher education institutions. It utilizes
              React JS for the frontend and Python for the backend. The module
              includes user-friendly forms for data entry, integration with
              existing systems like the Learning Management System (LMS) Port,
              and access to historical and current data under one umbrella. The
              system aims to reduce manual effort, ensure data accuracy, and
              streamline the NAAC reporting process. Proposed enhancements
              include improved user interface, advanced data validation,
              integration with external data sources, and enhanced analytics and
              reporting features. The project seeks to empower institutions to
              comply with accreditation standards and make data-driven decisions
              for continuous improvement.
